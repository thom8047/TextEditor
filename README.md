# TextEditor

A text editor in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Using jQuery for some of the more challenging DOM manipulation.

UPDATE!!!

Fixed up most bugs/cleaned code so now it'll follow that caret positioning rather then setting end of node contents!

Issues: 
- cannot type text in middle of editable
- need to split up each split by no space and that way we can have column data!
